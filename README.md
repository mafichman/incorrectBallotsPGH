A searchable database of potentially incorrect ballots published by the Allegheny County Elections Division, 11/6/2022

You can use this site to to see if your 2022 mail-in ballot for the November election was listed as "potentially incorrect" by the Allegheny County Elections Division (as of Nov. 6th) and in need of correction.

For information about how to correct your ballot, [please visit the Election Division's website](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/elections/incorrect,-no-date-ballots.aspx).

On November 6th, 2022, the Allegheny County Elections Division publicly published lists of ballots that might be "potentially incorrect" for various reasons. [They published 2 pdf and 2 Excel files to their website](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/elections/incorrect,-no-date-ballots.aspx) with lists of mail-in-ballots that had potential problems. The [announcement read](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/elections/incorrect,-no-date-ballots.aspx):

*"As there is not opportunity to notify impacted voters by letter of this decision and their opportunity to cure, we are instead providing a list of those voters who returned ballots in these two categories: no date and incorrectly dated."*

*"Voters may come to the Elections Division office, 326 County Office Building (3rd floor), 542 Forbes Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh and present photo ID and will be provided the opportunity to cure. This opportunity is available during regular business hours of 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM on Monday, November 7, 2022 and from 7 AM to 8 PM on Election Day, Tuesday, November 8, 2022."*

The Elections Division site also provides options for people who cannot travel due to disability and options for provisional ballots.

The databases they published were not searchable in a web browser. This site formats the data in a searchable tool.

This tool points directly to the URLs published by the City Commissioners. The code used to generate this searchable database [is open source and available](https://github.com/mafichman/incorrectBallotsPGH).
